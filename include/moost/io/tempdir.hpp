 * @brief Creates a unique temporary directory; removed on scope exit.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * Using this is safer than generating a temp filename and then creating
 * the file as this can lead to a race condition situation. By creating
 * a temporary directory (which the OS guarantees will be unique and not
 * used again for as long as it exists) and writing files to this new
 * location you can be sure you won't collide with another process.
