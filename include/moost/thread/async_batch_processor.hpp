/**
* @brief Allow a batch of jobs to be processed asyncronously whilst you wait
*
* There are times when you have a batch of data that needs to be processed and
* you want to process things asynchronously to maximise CPU usage.
*
* The premise behind how it works is pretty simple; you create a collection of
* jobs where a job is a functor loaded with your data and logic to process the
* data. You then dispatch threads to process the jobs. The jobs will then be
* processed asyncronously but the dispatcher will block until all the jobs are
* processed.
*
* It's like you are sending out a bunch of workers to dig a hole for you whilst
* you sit down and have a nice cup of tea :)
