/**
 * @brief Provide a filtered view of a boost directory_iterator
 *
 * The Boost directory_iterator provides no mechanism for filtering entries. The
 * glob_iterator provides a simple solution for this by presenting facade of a
 * filtered entries using the Boost filter_iterator and a suitable predicate
 * designed to allow filtering either using a regex or a glob pattern.
 *
 * The glob_iterator requires a directory_iterator and a glob_predicate, both
 * of which must have been previously contructed using suitable parameters. The
 * result is an iterator that will skip entries that do not meet the filtering
 * requirements.
 *
 * The name 'glob' has been used due to the fact that most of the time it is
 * expected that the filtering will be done using posix glob pattern matching;
 * however, internally these are converted into regular expessions so to provide
 * a more powerful/flexible alternative to glob patterns the glob_predicate can
 * also be constructed using a boost::regex object.
 *
 * When the glob_predicate is constructed using a glob pattern the whole glob
 * must match the filespec for it to be considered a match. When using regular
 * expressions a search is performed rather than a match so as to allow the
 * regex to define bounds using start and end anchors, as required.
 *
 * NB. If your filtering doesn't seem to work make sure you don't have any
 *     leading relative path for cwd (eg.  './foo' instead of 'foo') as the
 *     directory_iterator only considers "." and not "" as the cwd! :(
