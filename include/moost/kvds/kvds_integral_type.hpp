   /// This class represents a generic wrapper for standard C/C++ integral types.
   /// If you wish to support other types you need to implement your own version
   /// of this class that can serialise and deserialise the object in question
   /// as well as a vector of objects to facilitate support for getall() & putall().
   /// Serialising integral types is simple since we can just read/write to them
   /// directly (assuming endianess isn't a factor) but with custom types it
   /// will be necessary to provide a mutable and non-mutable byte representation
   /// of the actual type that can be written to and read from the database. In the
   /// case of, say, a vector this would just be the internal buffer given the vectors
   /// internal representation guarantees but in the case of, say, a string this
   /// is likely to require a seperate byte buffer be maintained that is used to
   /// reassemble the string from a mutable action. This is likely to be no more
   /// complex than using the vector<char> as a buffer and copying to/from the string.
