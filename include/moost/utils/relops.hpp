   /**
    * @brief Sub-class this to implement relops in your class
    *
    * @tparam T The type being compared
    *
    * @note Each operator takes its rhs as a type U, meaning that as long
    *       as T has implemented a == and < for type U it will be able to
    *       handle all the others (!=, >, <= & >=) for free
    *
    *       This framework isn't meant as a replacement for the Boost operators
    *       library; rather, it serves the single job of making the addition
    *       of relationship operators to a class as trivial as possible. Your
    *       class just exposes '==' and '<' and then sub-classs relops<T>. It
    *       will then get support for all relationship operators, both ways.
    *
    *       ie. X cmp Y and Y cmp X (where cmp is a relationship operator)
