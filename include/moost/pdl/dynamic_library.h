/**
 * Portable shared object loader and class factory
 *
 * This class manages shared library loading and unloading as well
 * as instantiation of classes provided by the shared libraries.
 *
 * It is only useful if the classes in these shared libraries have
 * been properly exported and inherit from moost::pdl::dynamic_class.
 *
 * It is crucial to understand how the lifetime of a shared library
 * is managed. A shared library is not unloaded while it is being
 * referenced from either a dynamic_library instance or any instance
 * of any class exported by that shared library. It will be immediately
 * unloaded once the last reference is gone. As a consequence, you have
 * to ensure that no instances (other than global instances) implemented
 * by the shared library have a lifetime that exceeds the lifetime of
 * the classes instantiated through dynamic_library.
 *
 * Instantiating a class within a shared library can be extremely easy:

\code
boost::shared_ptr<interface> i;
i = moost::pdl::dynamic_library(library).create<interface>(class_name);
\endcode

 * This will load the library \c library and create an instance of class
 * \c class_name implementing \c interface. Once \c i goes out of scope,
 * the instance will automatically be destroyed and the shared library
 * will be unloaded.
