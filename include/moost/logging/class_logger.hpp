 * \brief Declare a named class member logger

 * will create the logger on the initial call (this isn't thread safe but by calling it in the classes constructor we
 * can avoid that issue) and subsequent calls just return a member to the function static logger. Because the function
 * is virtual, you can override it in sub-classes to ensure that each class in the hierachy has it's own logger. Those
 * of you who are observant will spot a potential issue here -- it is generally considered unsafe to call a virtual
 * function from a constructor because at that time the v-table will not exist so the call will not be directed to the
 * more derived class. In this special case that is actually just fine because we don't want it to do that we do want it
 * to create the logger object for this instance and not any derived instances. Put simply, every class that implements
 * a class member logger needs to use the MLOG_INIT_NAMED_CLASS_LOGGER(logger) macro to ensure it's logger is created!

 * \brief Initialises a named class member logger
 *
 * Since the name of the class logger is derived using RTTI it can be very expensive to use the standard class logging
 * macros as they have to derive the class name each time they are called. Alternatively, you can create a class member
 * logger type, which only needs initialising once. First of all declare, in the class body, the logger as a member of
 * the class you wish to log for using the MLOG_DECLARE_LOGGER(logger) macro. Then, in the constructor of the class just
 * invoke the MLOG_INIT_CLASSMLOG_INIT_NAMED_CLASS_MEMBER_LOGGER_LOGGER(my_logger_) macro with the same name you used
 * when declaring it. Once your logger has been initialised you can use the standard (rather than the class specific)
 * MLOG functions, passing it your logger
 *
 * Defining your logger as a class member rather than using the class logging convenience macros below is a matter of
 * choice but if your code is performance critical this will allow you to avoid any unnecessary logging overhead.
 *
 * /note This MUST be called in the constructor body and not the initialisation list because it needs access to "this".
