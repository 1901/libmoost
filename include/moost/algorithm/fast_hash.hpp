/**
 * \file fast_hash.h
 * A really fast hash function.
 * can be used either as free function (fast_hash) or as function FastHash
 * Examples:
\code
  // simple hash function
  int toHash = 10;
  size_t hash = moost::algorithm::fast_hash( &toHash, sizeof(int) );

  // or as functor
  boost::dense_hash_map<
       int, // the key
       int, // the value
       moost::algorithm::FastHash // the hashing function
     > aMap;

  aMap[34341] = 3;
\endcode
* If you plan to use a non-pod type (be VERY careful!) for the key
* you can disable the static check by declaring MOOST_FASTHASH_NO_ISPOD_CHECK
\note This is \b sdbm from from http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html

// *** BIG IMPORTANT WARNING!!! ***
// If you plan to use fast_hash to hash a custom type, including structs you
// need to understand that they can and probably will contain padding. Since
// the compiler is not at liberty to initialise padding, if you create two
// instances of a struct and initialise each member with the same value there
// is a very good change when you hash each instance you will generate
// different digests. The only way to make this safe is to use memset to zero
// out the whole object first. Note that struct foo = {0} does NOT set all
// bytes in the objects memory to 0, it does a member by member initialisation
// and thus padding is still uninitialised.
// Also, this should NOT be used for non-POD types, since the memory layout
// of a non-POD type is compiler specific and there can be no assumptions
// made. If you need to hash a custom object you are better off making an
// array of bytes out of the various member values that should form part
// of the hash and then send that to fast_hash. For example, if we have
// a non-POD class that contains of key/value pairs and the key is made up of
// 2 integer values (a composite key) this would be one safe way to create
// a hash from the key...
//       int32_t i32s[] = {key.first, key.second};
//       size_ t h = moost::algorithm::fast_hash(i32s, sizeof(i32s));
