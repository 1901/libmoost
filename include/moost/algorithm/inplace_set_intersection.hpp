// and that this would be safe:
// std::set_intersection(foo.begin(), foo.end(), bar.begin(), bar.end(), foo.begin());
// however, the preconditions of set_intersection (http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/set_intersection.html)
// explicitly state that the output range and input ranges should not overlap
// so just to be safe, we'll write our own
