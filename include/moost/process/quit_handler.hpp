   /// This class represent and very simple way to trap and handle termination
   /// signals. It is not and never was intended to be a fully fledged signal
   /// handling framework. It's only job in life is to allow you to register
   /// a handler (which can be a simple free standing function or a functor),
   /// which will be called if any of the standard (and trapable) signals are
   /// raised. The idea is that you use your custom handler to shutdown your
   /// process gracefully; allowing you to persist data and stop services.
   ///
   /// To use it just call it from an approppriate place in your main thread
   /// before you start any services or actions that might need clearing up
   /// on termination. It is up to you to ensure your custom handler shuts
   /// down your process. The normal action of termination will be disabled.
   ///
   /// By default SIGABRT is also handled but you can disable this as required.
   ///
   /// By default SIGHUP is not handled. You can add this if required but the
   /// preferred method is to use the "hup_handler" and reload the config.
   //
   /// Note, SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are not handled (this is a Posix restriction).
