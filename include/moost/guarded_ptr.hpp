/**
 * @file guarded_ptr.hpp
 *
 * @brief scoped pointer paired with a mutex
 *
 * If objects of type 'foo' are not inherently thread-safe to use, a guarded_ptr
 * can be used to add locking around the foo object. A guarded_ptr cannot make
 * any arbitrary object automagically thread-safe, but it pairs the pointer to
 * the object with a mutex and only gives you access to the object while you
 * are holding a lock. The developer still needs to know what locks (shared or
 * exclusive) are necessary to carry out operations on the object. Shared locks
 * will only grant you access to a const-reference of the object.
 *
 * Also, just like with other smart pointers, you need to follow some rules in
 * order to benefit from the smartness. There are certainly ways to obtain a
 * pointer to the original object through some methods. Saving such a pointer and
 * using it in other places will undermine the benefits. (As it would if you did
 * the same for e.g. a shared_ptr.)
 *
 * @code
 * moost::guarded_ptr<foo> bar(new foo);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The guarded_ptr object has no methods to call. Upon destruction it will take of
 * destruction of the foo object.
 *
 * To use the object referenced by bar, a lock must be acquired.
 *
 * @code
 * moost::guarded_ptr<foo>::shared_access barlock(bar);
 * barlock->some_const_method_of_foo();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The lock is kept until barlock runs out of scope. The shared_access object keeps
 * are shared lock of the mutex in the guarded_ptr object. shared_access implements
 * operator* and operator->, which both return a const-pointer to the underlying foo
 * object. If you need to call non-const methods, you will have to acquire an
 * exclusive lock, for which a class exclusive_lock exists.
 *
 * @code
 * moost::guarded_ptr<foo>::exclusive_access barlock(bar);
 * barlock->some_method_of_foo();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The exclusive_access class works much like shared_access, but it acquires a full,
 * exclusive lock of the mutex within guarded_ptr. It allows to call const and non-const
 * methods of the underlying object.
 *
 * There is also an upgradable_access class.
 *
 * @code
 * moost::guarded_ptr<foo>::upgradable_access barlock(bar);
 * barlock->some_const_method_of_foo();
 * moost::guarded_ptr<foo>::upgradable_access::upgrade barlock2(barlock);
 * barlock2->some_method_of_foo();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The upgradable_access constructor acquires an upgradable lock. It secures shared
 * access to the object which can later be upgraded to exclusive access. The
 * upgradable_access object itself only yields const-pointers to the underlying
 * object, but an upgrade object can be constructed from it, which then also offers
 * non-const pointers. Upon construction of the (first) upgrade object from an
 * upgradable_access object, the lock held by upgradable_access is promoted to an
 * exclusive lock.
 *
 * @note
 * Objects of types shared_access, exclusive_access, upgradable_access and upgrade
 * must never outlive the objects they were created from.
