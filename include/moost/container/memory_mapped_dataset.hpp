/**

 *
 * The moost::container::memory_mapped_dataset class help constructing
 * custom datasets that can be easily mapped into memory.
 *
 * There is currently support for vectors of POD types and collections
 * of serialiseable types through the help of boost::archive.
 *
 * Each vector or collection is represented by its own section in the
 * dataset and each dataset can contain an arbitrary number of sections.
 *
 * Support for other section types can be added in the future.
